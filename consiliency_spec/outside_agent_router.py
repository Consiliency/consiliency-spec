"""Reference intake router for the outside-agent contract.

This module is the **normative executable oracle** for
`outside_agent_route_verdict.v0.1`. Given an outside-agent submission it returns
the route verdict that a conforming intake implementation MUST produce.

Scope boundary (unchanged from `docs/outside-agent-contract.md`): this is intake
routing only. It never grants merge acceptance, Portal projection state, or any
downstream authority — `acceptance_truth_owner` stays `governed_pipeline`.

It exists because the conformance corpus declares an `expected_verdict` and an
`expected_blocker_class` per vector, and until now nothing derived those values:
the corpus could only be checked for *vocabulary*, so a wrong verdict was
unobservable. A conformance runtime that cannot fail is not a fence.

`jsonschema` is imported lazily, so importing `consiliency_spec` stays
dependency-free; install the `outside-agent` extra to use the router.
